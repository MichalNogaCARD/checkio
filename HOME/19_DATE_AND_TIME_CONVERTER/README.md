 Computer date and time format consists only of numbers, for example: 21.05.2018 16:30
Humans prefer to see something like this: 21 May 2018 year, 16 hours 30 minutes
Your task is simple - convert the input date and time from computer format into a "human" format.

example

Input: Date and time as a string

Output: The same date and time, but in a more readable format

Example:
date_time("01.01.2000 00:00") == "1 January 2000 year 0 hours 0 minutes"
date_time("19.09.2999 01:59") == "19 September 2999 year 1 hour 59 minutes"
date_time("21.10.1999 18:01") == "21 October 1999 year 18 hours 1 minute"
# NB: words "hour" and "minute" are used only when time is 01:mm (1 hour) or hh:01 (1 minute).
# In other cases it should be used "hours" and "minutes".
